Hi, I am a hobbyist AI Research Engineer.

**Welcome to my blog.**

At the intersection of technical precision and ethical responsibility lies impactful work. 
*The Mindful Parameter* explores how small adjustments in AI systems create rippling effects across society. 

Here, I document my journey toward alignment - carefully tuning each parameter with awareness of its downstream implications.
Parameters (weights & biases) are fundamental to how AI systems function - they encode what the system has learned and dictate its behavior. 

*Being mindful about parameters means being attentive to the entire representation learned by the system*

As I explore the field of AI Alignment, I hope to remain mindful about the concerns around AI, and share my learnings as I go.

**Thanks for visiting!**
